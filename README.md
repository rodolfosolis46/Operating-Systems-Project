Our project currently consists of prompting the user to input their username and password to a hardcoded combination. Not only that but processes and scheduling have been implemented successfully.

To run the project simply load the following files onto visual studio code or visual studio: OSProject.cpp , auth.cpp , auth.h, process.h, process.cpp, scheduling.h, and scheduling.cpp . Afterwards compile the OSProject.cpp and input the hardcoded username and password located within the OSProject.cpp file and you should succesfully have logged on to the OS.
